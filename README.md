Front-end built in pyqt5 which wraps ffmpeg.  Converts media file type to another type.
I built this because I needed something with a UI to convert a bunch of MPG4 files to MOV.
Feel free to fork and change something for your own needs. If you feel it is good enough, submit a pull request to this main repo.
I am using Travis CI to verify builds with some pytests.  Any pytests you want to add? Ok, go for it.
Thanks.
